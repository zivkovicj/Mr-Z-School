LOOK INTO GRANTS OR AGENCIES TO FUND THIS WORK FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR
 
BEFORE AUG 15, TRY TO INCLUDE CUMULATIVE STARS IN THE SCORESHEET

Be aware of whether it shows all possible correct answer when a student views her finished quiz.

EMAIL THE TEACHERS WHO HAD STARTED AN ACCOUNT IN THE OLD APP


    
    

2.26 IMAGES WITH QUESTIONS--STARTED 08/23/17

Goal of this update: Allow teachers to associate uploaded images with specific questions. 

V List options for labels when uploading a new image

V Don't show destroy or edit button in picture index if the current_user isn't the correct one.
    V Finish testing for this

V Question edit form lists the images for the selected label

V Display that image when the student is answering the riposte

V quiz_size needs to be bigger. about twice

V Picture should also show in the quiz report

V Check whether checkboxes allow for changing labels

V Need option for "No picture" that is set by default
    V And can be set if user makes a mistake in clicking a picture.
    
V Test changing picture in question edit form.
    
V Finish "destroy" controller method for questions so that questions can be deleted.

V Test for editing a question and changing its picture

V Test in development
    V Test changing the image manually
    V Test changing a question to "No picture" manually

V Re-insert the line that sets current_class to nil so that when editing questions, objectives, and labels, the back-link directs to teacher's show page, not a scoresheet.

V Show image thumbnail in question index

Migrate to add :user to pictures
    And make sure that no pictures have a nil user
    



HOTFIXES

Screen for editing a label has headline twice.

When I was logged-in as an admin, I went back to the home screen, then tried to get to my profile. It threw an error because it tried to go to the students show page.
    
If a label is deleted, all the questions that had that label should be changed to "Unlabeled"

Listing all available questions when editing a label is super-annoying. Need to add another "Save Changes" button higer up.
    I think I should eliminate this list of questions period.
    I give the option to create a new label while creating questions, then it won't be tedious to add many questions to the same label.
    
Option to not scramble the answer choices for multiple-choice questions.

"Unlabeled" should come first in every list. Maybe just start it with a zero.

Labels need the domain prefix.

Labels should be ordered by name wherever they are listed.
    Should pictures also?

Blank out links for users to upload pictures until I get that feature fixed.



BENCHMARK STARS

    Each student_seminar will have a benchmark stars column. When the teacher clicks the benchmark, it will save each student's current total of stars for that seminar
    
    There will be columns that show total stars, last benchmark, and stars since last benchmark
    
    This will help with marking term grades
    
    
        
        
    
GROWTH POINTS

Need to add "last_growth" type column to objective_sudent
    When a student improves score, update last_growth to today's date
    If there is growth, but last_growth was the same day, then don't add growth points. (They need to take it again on a different day to earn those points.)



 
DISABLE "NEXT QUESTION" BUTTON UNTIL STUDENT CHOOSES A RESPONSE
 
 Test deleting of pictures
 
 It's weird that a picture can have "Unlabeled" along with other labels. Should be one or the other.
 


   
CURATED QUESTIONS

Should have another type of user called "Content Creator"

Admin or content creators can curate questions.
    
Teachers can choose whether their students will see all questions, or only curated questions.

   
 




FIX TESTS FOR DESK CONSULTANTS
    
    figure out why all students start out being marked as absent

    Also, rank assignments by need should be based on the most requested, not the highest need. Maybe.
        That should at least run quicker, because requested is a simple column in the join table. Not a method that looks at every student's readiness. 




TESTS TO ADD
    
If user goes to "Create New Objective" through a seminar view, re-route to that seminar. If not, re-route to user page.
    
students_edit_test is in the test/controllers folder. Should probably move to integration

Test that new user info is saved downcase

Are the apprentice request choices taking pre-requisites into account?

Test whether student is placed if priority or cthresh changes after request has been made.

Capybara test for chart attendance?

The piece of code that places straggling students should also check for the priority of the learnrequest, and whether the student has passed preReqs

Upon adding a new class, make sure that cumulative stars are set to zero.

Test that learnRequest is set to nil if student doesn't have a learnRequest available. I think that means if learnOptions turns up an empty set.

Test that removing a student from a class doesn't delete his/her scores?

Tried for a few hours to test clicking on the learn_request_requests to see if it changes that student's request. It seems like I need the capybara-webkit gem 
    to do that. But installing that gem seemed impossible at the time. I think the problem was the workspace enviroment that resulted from the Rails Tutorial.
    Might be worth looking into that again.

Make a plan for how to roll out updates after more uers are using the apps.

Tests for learn_request and teach_request

Write a test for
    Remove an objective from a class
    Remove a class from an objective
    Remove a question from a label
    
Ensure that when the user edits an objective, that the pre-reqs are correct. Check that it is not keeping all of the previous pre-reqs, plus any
    new ones that the user adds.

Test that absent students are excluded from DeskConsultants

Test that students assigned as consultants have a good score in that objectives

Test that students assigned as apprentices haven't yet mastered that objective

See what happens if users enter improper data types in different fields. And test for those.

Deleting a question

Deleting a picture

All of the "edit tests" need to ensure that no changes occur if the user presses "Save Changes" without actually changing anything
    I ran into a problem with the label for questions not checking the correct label
    
    



OPTION TO COPY A CLASS

    Include settings for objective and pretest.
        But the name must be unique
        
    When creating/editing a class, the first screen shows only the field for class name
    
    When creating a class, there is a list of already-created classes. The teacher can choose one of them to copy.
    
    Other screens have the option to "Go back to your profile" or "Continue to set pretests" or "Continue to set priorities"
    
    


    

ADD INFO BUTTONS FOR ALL FIELDS ON ALL FORMS

There's a blanked-out info button to explain pre-requisites in the objectives form.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" id="btn-info1">?</button>

The jquery for showing those info buttons needs to be dried down to one single function.




CURRENT CLASS AS A REFERENCE, NOT AN INTEGER    
    
    After deploy, migrate, reset, and seed with heroku
    
    

  
STUDENT VIEW INTO MULTIPLE SUB-VIEWS

    Students should be able to view their old quizzes.
    
    Won't need to setup scores in all the tests that view the student_view
    
    
  
REMOVE QUIZ FROM DESK CONSULTANTS OFFERINGS AFTER STUDENT HAS TAKEN IT TWICE

    Count the number of attempts since the most recent time working that objective with desk consultants
        If there are more than one, that quiz is no longer offered to the student.
    
    Or else close after one attempt if the day ends
    
    Automatically add consultant stars
    

TEACHER MANUAL QUIZ UNLOCKS

    Teacher clicking student can check which quizzes should be unlocked for that
        student.
        
    Or through objective to check which quizzes should be unlocked for which
        student.
        
    Or unlock a quiz for an entire class.



LINK TO THE MATERIALS SITE SO THAT I CAN SHARE THE MATERIALS I'VE CREATED

    Change the heroku name
    
    Make sure that everything is functioning for the regular site in case people start using it.
    
    Add "Coming Soon: Goals" to the Teacher show page.
    
    Need an icon for every class. Seminar, Teacher, etc.
    
    Update the materials site


QUESTIONS AND PICTURES INDEX

   Test that incorrect user cannot delete any records from models with correct_owner function

IMPROVED CONSULTANT ORDER
    
    RankByConsulting should be based on how long it's been since a student has served as a consultant in the given class period.
    
    Find the median of "Since Consulting" days. Half it.
        Add that half-median to the students who have requested to be consultant more often
        Subtract that half-median from the students who have requested not to be consultant.
        
    Redo the tests that used to depend on :adjustedConsultingPoints
    
    By looking at currently-created teams, I'm losing the feature that gives new students
    a break period before they are asked to be consultants. That should come back
    in some form.

TEACHER CAN ADJUST CONSULTANCY

    Then save consultancy after adjusting

    In creating Consultant groups, create a group of absent students so they can be placed into groups as they arrive to class.



STUDY LINKS

    objective can have up to 4 study links.
    
    Teachers can set those links to outside websites.
        Links to sites and games to practice needed concepts

    Students can view them and follow the path.
    
    Students can take some quizzes as practice.



IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OF DESK-CONSULTANTS MAKER    

    Limit the loading of jquery library
    
    
    
    

ADD SOMETHING FUN OR INTERESTING BEFORE MORE BORING FEATURES

Perhaps student comments within classes. 




TRY TO CHANGE CURRENT_CLASS TABLE DB ATTRIBUTE TO SESSION ATTRIBUTE

Take another look at students_new_test. The test is setting the current_class to nil for some reason.
    But don't put any more time into that issue until I find a better way to keep track of current_class, which will be in the cookies or by sending
        parameters.

Figure out what's the deal with refreshing the "question details" screen


MORE QUIZ UNLOCKS
    
    Unlock quiz if student has clicked at least two "study links"
        
        That part should go into the Score model.
        
        Don't show a quiz available if it has no questions
    
    
    
IN-APP GOAL TRACKING   

        
    
ONLY ALLOW QUIZ-TAKING ON CERTAIN DAYS AND TIMES        
    Main Goal: Teacher can lock and unlock quizzes
        Seminar needs an "unlocked days" attribute.
            It will be an array that includes the available days.
            Unlock time
            Re-lock time
        Teacher can set this up in class attributes once. So that quizzes are open
          on a certain day between a certain start and end time.
    
    Students cannot take the quiz outside of the open time.
        Unlocking lasts for a few hours, or a day
    
    But there also needs to be an "Unlock quizzes" button in case students
       are taking them on a different day.
       
       
    
ACCOUNT ACTIVATIONS

    Since the teacher's profile shows a request for them to activate their account, it should also include a link to send a second activation email. 
    Or get rid of that message until I do have that taken care of.

NEED TO REDO ALL THE STUFF ABOUT MAILERS

ADMIN CAN CREATE NEW ADMIN

    Admin need to be able to edit their own profile
    
    
    
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

maybe allow images as answer choices. would make fractions much nicer.

and what about an equation-editor answer box so that students can type fractions

    for now, might be easier to implement multi-box fill-in answers. then the student can input the numerator and denominator.

Public/Private Extent for Pictures

Alert the teacher if she is creating a fill-in question without any correct answers

The table on the user profile page is getting too busy. Perhaps the "Objectives" button should be left in the Seminar edit page. And what about consultancies?
    Where should I link to those?


Allow for partial searching if user knows part of the name or question he's searching for.
    And eliminate spaces from the searches.
         

Test for searching for every model that has an index
    objectives
    Labels
    Questions
    User
        
Allow students to be marked as ELL. When that happens, they are default exempt from text-heavy objectives.
   
Look at whether I should organize my migrations
        
Option to show "My questions only" in "All Questions"
        
After adding a new objective, it should re-route to the scoresheet, not to the seminar edit view.
        
Check for more possible spots where a failsafe is needed. Like if it cannot find the objective that was requested.    
        
Can I edit users and students from the admin screens?
        
Margin on the subtitle under EM Education
        
Header links are hard to see.

The UI of the scoresheet needs to allow for arrow key navigation
    If I can't figure out how to make the header stay fixed above the columns, then I at least need to split the table into smaller tables.

        
The "total" field in the scoresheet should update upon changing one of that students' scores.
 
Some other symbol, instead of zero, should go in the scoresheet to keep track of objectives that haven't been attempted yet.
        
Option to make a student exempt from an objective
        
Fix the semianrs.show view. It's worthless right now.
        
When there's only one public objective, the list looks really weird.
    I'm sure the problem is the same for private objectives.
            
The "Questions" controller needs before_action stoppers
    And the questions_index_test needs to test for them
    And check which other models need similar updates

Use CSS for before/after margin on div class="singleOption" instead of using </br>
        
@createdLabel needs to include the users full title
        
Reloading label form directs to index
        
Better icons for DConsult, etc.
        
Add enough question fixtures to test pagination in index
    Same with labels
    objectives
    Students
    Users
            
Put icons on all of the buttons, such as "Create a New Label" and "All Labels" The "All Labels" icon should include more labels than the regular.
        
Make a partial for the name and extent on each form.
        
When the user is slecting the number of questions from each label, that select box will be blank for a label that has no questions. This screen 
    needs some kind of warning or explanation for this fact.
            
When creating a multiple-choice question, don't allow the user to mark a blank answer as the correct answer.
    But at least one answer choice must be marked as true.
    And at least two answer choices are offered.
        
If student has taken a quiz six times, the oldest attempt is destroyed
        
In the quiz-finishing screen, give options for the student to change his/her consultant requests.

When editing a question, the user can change the label, but the pictures offered will still be the pictures for the old label. It should refresh the screen to 
    offer picture choices to go along with the new label. Make sure to set the default check too.

Teach and Learn Request should be made into an association, not just an integer.
        
Multiple-select questions
        
Don't give message, "Students added to class" if zero students were added. Also, give errors if any students were not saved. Do the same with the 
    multi-question creator.
        
"Has_objective" method should probably be removed and replaced with rails association
         
Ensure that students cannot url into unauthorized objectives 

Adjust scores to keep a record so that students can have multiple scores in the same objective. And make landmark dates for term endings.

Edit multiple questions at once

Check out whether some performance can be improved if I add indices to certain table columns
    
Will also need to look up how to better test performance.

Some changes are made by ajax. Some changes are made with a Save + Submit button. That should be consistent.

"I don't like these consultant groups" button after D-C results. User clicks this button to get ideas about how to improve the results.

If so, there should be a warning message that occurs before the user submits an objective with priority 3.

Clicking in Consultant Point column doens't activate crosshairs.

At the very end, if there's a single student in a group, and another group has the same topic, move one of the students from the group to work with the lone student.

Suggestion to student for which objective to study next should prioritize a score of zero that the student is ready for. 
    I think the same should go for apprentice requests.

Include precondition info in the assigments index.

If a student has already made a request, that request should appear in the student's choices even if it didn't come up from priority and scores.

Check before_action for security of student page

After performing a search, the search option should default to the previously-used attribute, instead of defaulting to user_number

Consultants display would look better if the group had a thick border, but the cells did not.

http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project

Home screen should offer log in space instead of having to click the log in button to reach the login form.

Add multiple pictures at once

A button where teachers can reset all requests

Allow teachers to delete their own accounts

Teacher should be able to set a consultantThreshold individually for each objective.

If user tries to add an existing student to a class twice, it produces a fatal error. But I think that only happens when c9 or something is being super slow.

destroy method in student controller should include destroying the seminar_student. Or maybe when I need to destroy students by hand, I destroy their seminar_student instead.

For now, I disabled the seating chart edit mode because it was creating the problem with a broken seating-chart array. Should probably put that back soon. 
    The seating chart view is all commented out right now.

When I do bring that back, I need custom sizes for seating charts. At least allow four wide or eight wide.

Print list of student names and passwords

It's awkward that "student_view" is in the seminar controller. It should be in the 
student controller.

Add Instructions in the Help menu

Include the paper materials that were created for presentations.

"Add rows for ten more students" should be a button, not a link.

Offer a mean and median score report at the bottom of the scoresheet.

Reports for objectives and questions

Track scores by term, so that teacher can see which scores are from the current term.

Update a student's learn_requests when that student passes an objective. 
    If that student had learn_requested to learn the objective she just passed, her learn_request should become neutral.
    
Offer a ribbon at the bottom of seminar show pages that allows for editing the class, adding students, etc.

Test for Hide Scoresheet

Look for chances to improve the appearance.

"You're logged-in as..." message

Consistent cell size in scoresheet

Consistent cell size in desk-consultants

Figure out how to handle scores by term. Maybe "archive" some scores into past scores. Probably better to allow for term switching like the programs that 
    most teachers are accustomed to.

Admin should be able to create classes for the users that they are visiting?

Allow teachers to customize how many groups wide their seating chart displays.

And customize the size of each group.

Zebra striping for columns?

Larger font on main headings.

Require login to view materials. But first offer a preview. Some materials should be in the paid section.

Transfer students to a different class period

Video to walk people through initial setup.

Create a school property for students. Mostly just for indexing. Or maybe a school district attribute. And teachers can only search students from their own district.

If there's trouble logging in, add a message reminding users that teachers use an e-mail address, but students use a username.

Taking the last student out of the "Temporary Placement Area" makes it disappear.

I commented out the "Remember me on this computer" feature. Should I leave it gone? or should I try to bring it back?

Flash message upon updating score error?

Student awards feature, so students can vote for each other for "Most helpful", "Most creative," "Funniest," etc.

Adjust seating chart by achievement Students shouldn't just be in order from low to high. They need to be organized 
    with highest paired with mid-highest

Look again at Hartl's section about not editing admin via the web.

Add "Created_by" to student. It will keep track of which teacher created that student

Reset absences upon starting a new day.

Upload student roster from Excel

Allow teachers to reset student passwords, but not to edit them.

Turn all of the hints into a system of daily hints that appear upon login. Add: Remind teachers to add objectives that nobody has completed yet. Those will
    become the enrichment objectives for students who are not placed in a group.

On the "New Student" form, highlight the first and last name fields, since they're the only ones that teachers actually need to fill out.

Fix the double horzontal line that shows after each student when somebody searches the student index.

When creating a new objective, should it automatically check the box for the current class if the objectives form was accessed through a class?
    
It's a little bit weird that user can't leave second answer choice blank. But that's not a really big problem.

Add an attribute to quiz called "progress" that keeps track of how many questions
    the student has answered from that quiz.  In case the student is interrupted mid-quiz.
    
A better visual for the student's total stars can include some big stars for 10 and some giant stars for 100 
    
Allow teachers and admin to edit their user_numbers upon creation and updating
    Offer a field in the regular form, but hide it until a button is pressed.
    
Right now the make_username method ends by generating a random token if the first four tries fail. If the site ever has a million users, I'll need to ensure that
    it's generating a unique token for the username


*** FEATURES TO CONSIDER

Small icons for each class period

Upload student photos. Or have student icons.
