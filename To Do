BUSINESS / MARKETING TO-DO'S

Look at Allen Maxwell's Snowbird app to see if I can help him to improve his code
    See if pagination loads all rows before index view, or if it only loads one page.
    If so, his app can be made far smoother with queries.

Find other collaborators
    It seems I've reached a point where it's foolish to continue all this work that I'm doing on my own. Is it time to seek other teachers to help develop study guides and lesson plans?
    Is it more important to seek additional software devs to get the site up to speed?
    Is it more important to seek investors so that I can pay salaries to the other people who are helping?
    Lately, I'm feeling more like the GoalTracker feature might be more useful to a wider variety of teachers. (At least, it might be more useful sooner).  Spreading that feature is 
        a more attainable goal than spreading the DeskConsultants feature. Is it foolish to change the main business plan at this point? If I do change the plan, how does that affect 
        my decision for proceeding with content writers, coders, or investors?
    How about this plan:
        Continue developing GoalTracker myself until next spring.
        In Spring, pursue opportunities to spread the work to other teachers. Get a few more teachers using the app and giving feedback.
        Then I'll have something to pitch to companies/investors
        Content takes a backseat, because it isn't very useful for GoalTracker, only for DeskConsultants. Only develop what I need for my own students.
        

Look into Investors
    Angel Investors seem like the best route to pursue at this point
    First, cover expenses such as Certification and Hosting
    Then try to secure funding to pay coders and content-creators
    If possible, use some funds for marketing
    
Make the landing page do a better job of explaining and selling the app

Make three videos
    One to explain the need for this app
    One to explain the evolution of why it needs to work this way
    One to show samples of the app in action

Upload videos and link to them on social media
    Look at which teacher's forums I should have a presence on
    Tag other teacher's related profiles on Twitter
    Connect on LinkedIn

Private Repo on Github

Tried to find out why some students are occasionally being left alone in a group as the consultant. From a close look at the code, I cannot see why that's happening.
Keep eyes open for that problem. 





Check Quiz scores to give credit to student who passed adding integers and subtracting integers when they were sevvies

Check Pre-Reqs for "Both-Side Equation" Objectives 



2.71 FACULTY CAN MARK SCHOOL COMMODITIES DELIEVERED

When visiting market page, faculty can see all com_studs that have recently been updated
    This is default page.  Managing the market is an option from this page.
Notices are sorted to put unfulfilled orders at the top (delivered is less than quantity ordered)
Faculty can mark an item as delivered
    Mark one delivered
    Mark fewer delivered
    Or mark all

Stars and gems are marked false by default in the deliverable column




OPTION TO PUT "RECENTLY MARKED DELIEVERED" AT TOP

This will help office staff in case an item was marked as delivered when it shouldn't have been.


GIVE SCHOOL BUCKS





REMEMBER WHETHER TEACHER WANTS TO SHOW "ALL OBJECTIVES" OR CURRENTLY-USED OBJECTIVES






ORGANIZE CONTENT CREATION BUTTONS

Probably set up a "content creation" screen that organizes those buttons better.   


TEACHER CAN CREATE COMMODITIES FOR A SINGLE SEMINAR

Mentor teacher can create new teachers who are automatically verified
All of these admin teachers can create new students without placing them into a class
Only stars and gems will offer the use button
Teacher can allow and disallow the use of stars and gems in a specific class
Cannot delete star or gem commodity
Teacher can edit her individual commodities
Teacher can open and close availability for certain commodities


TEACHER CAN TAKE CLASS CURRENCY (IN CASE OF A MISTAKE)

Admin teachers can create new students without placing them into a class

Teacher can make a comment while giving some currency

Currency moves with student if student changes classes

Teachers have limited amount of currency to give

Teacher can give bucks to whole class.
    Screen that allows unchecking boxes from certain students
    Custom controller action that loops through whole class
    
    
    
LEVEL 2 ADMIN CAN REMOVE A TEACHER FROM THE SCHOOL
    
    


HOTFIXES
Development app added six quiz keys upon clicking the whole class button
Can I re-name the "present" attribute of the seminar student?  That's already a ruby word.
For the sake of performance, the method "set_pretests" should only be called when pretests are changed.  Right now, it is getting called when
    anything about the seminar is changed.
Tests to add
Adding bucks sometimes adds double or even quad.
Seems to stop doing that after a refresh
Check pagination everywhere it occurs
Don't block the "Desk Consultants" icon when it isn't availble. Instead, re-route to a screen that explains what is needed.



QUIZ FINISHING

Show the number of keys left in the quiz report
If student has scored 100, then end-of-quiz message reads, "You have scored 100% on this objective.  There is no need to take the quiz again."



SHOW ALL TYPES OF KEYS

Key fields should show dc keys and pretest keys in a different color
Check this in student quiz-finishing, student_seminar show page, teacher views student, and teacher views objective








TEACHER-GRADED QUESTIONS



GEM MARKET
Students can buy gems
Gems can be used toward class reward
Gems can be sold back to the market

Teacher can see account values for whole class
Account values screen includes commodities owned and the total value

Screen to keep track of progress toward reward
Teacher can name the reward
Allow teacher to reset reward
Re-establish new reward target based on number of students in class

Allow teacher to customize whether stars and gems can be used in their class
But many commodity attributes need to be set school-wide
    (The main reason to focus on prices school-wide is to reduce competition within a class period)
    Change the supply (number per student per term)
    Standard price
    Day when new items are released
Limit teachers to the number of bucks they can give
    Based on number of students that teacher has

School-wide leaderboard of most class currency
    (only tracks savings account, not commodities)
    Only shows bucks from current term.
    
Class-wide leaderboards of most class currency

Allow a commission on specific classes to change the difficulty compared to other classes

Students gain daily interest on their savings accounts

Future update:
    
    To make the game more fair for students who arrive late, I would like to reset the leaderboard at some point.
        This will also reign in students who begin making ridiculous levels of interest
        But resetting the leaderboard means that I need to set everybody to zero assets.
        How do I do that without robbing students of what they've accumulated?


FLUCTUATING PRICES

Prices of stars and gems fluctuate based on supply in market
    current_price is updated daily
    Each item has a standard price.
    Item's price will equal standard when the supply in the store equals that item's standard supply.
        I think standard amount should equal about five weeks worth of production
    Current price is updated daily. (so that first period doesn't have a huge advantage for being able to buy first)
        Current price is based on standard supply / current supply * standard price
        Add a flat amount to each to ease the spike on ridiculous price increase
            Flat amount is 10% of standard supply
        Examples
            Standard supply   600  (120 x 5 weeks)
            Current supply    900  (Students have bought hardly anything for 2 1/2 weeks)
            700 / 1000 = 0.7 * 5 = $3.5
            
            Current supply  200
            700 / 300 = 2.3 * 5 = $11.67
    Triple the standard is maximum price
    
Students or whole classes can opt out of the price fluctuations.
    The default is to be opted out.

MORE DETAILED REPORT FOR STUDENTS TO SEE HER SCORES

Also, stop putting students as apprentices where they have passed the objective at the consultant threhold.
At the end of a quiz, DC needs to offer students “I don’t want to use the rest of my keys”
There's too much space with all he headers and stuff at the top.  Condense that.

END-OF-TERM STUFF
Give teachers an option to delete unfinished quizzes at the end of a term.
    This will prevent students from finishing quizzes that they started in a previous term
In the same view, also give teacher the option to erase keys
    This will only erase teacher keys and dc keys.  Not pretest keys

TESTS FOR UPDATING SCORESHEET
Alert teacher if she's leaving with unsaved changes.


NON-QUIZ OBJECTIVES 
Some objectives, such as paper cranes and tessellations, won't ever offer a quiz.
    So there shouldn't be an option for quiz keys.
    And they should be skipped on the student's quiz offerings.
    
    


TESTS TO ADD

    Make sure Admin can find all students
Deleting a consultancy deletes its teams
Test that incorrect user cannot delete any records from models with correct_owner function
Ensure that database inputs are sanitized
Test failing at creating a record, then fixing it. Needs to apply to creating a new record and also to editing an existing record.

The piece of the DC algorithm that places straggling students should also check for the priority of the learnrequest, and whether the student has passed preReqs
If teacher reached "Create New Objective" through a seminar view, re-route to that seminar. If not, re-route to user page.
Test that consultant_days doesn't include other seminars
Test that a limited number of groups are created if many students are qualified to connsult.
    With priority 3's
    And total consultants
Are_some_unplaced test failed once, but it usually passes. I think it failed because @student_10 became a consultant, so he wasn't in the unplaced group.
Test that checkpoints are displayed in the correct order?
Navigating Seminar_Student view. Certain fields should be visible/invisible
Test the navribbon in the seminar edit view.
    I tried writing tests for the navribbon in the student class page, but the visible tags weren't working in the capybara tests.
Student using the sub-tabs to navigate the seminar_student view
Mr. Z School needs to test a student visiting when there is a teacher comment.
Should I enforce that term start and end dates are sequential?  I think I should





INCLUDE PARENT E-MAIL FOR STUDENTS
E-mail students when a checkpoint deadline is coming up
    Might need for the teacher to do that manually
    Or maybe an e-mail can be scheduled when the goal is set.
Also e-mail parents
E-mail when a comment is made on a student's goal

Live site has errors in student searching. It occurred when trying to add Melissa Suess to 7th period
V Consultants button in NavBar needs to link to consultancy show page  
Set up billing alerts with AWS.

Deleting a consultancy from its own show page isn't working right now.
Put goals in NavRibbon
Fix NavRibbon for Desk Consultants
Don't mark a student as consultant if the student is alone. It wastes that student's consultant turn.

    Either that, or I need to update my tests to RSpec
Student Goal Icon
Desk Consultants should have “Max Group Size” for topics such as Chess.
There should also be Max Number of groups, so that I don’t end up with more than four groups doing chess when I have four boards.
I also need to add multiple, already-existing students to a class at once.
Searching by student number threw an error
Need the option to zoom in on one student's goal
DC should NOT go back and place students into groups if they've already passed the objective.  New learning is more
    important than having a group
Need to allow for multiple teachers to leave comments.
So the comment needs to have the ID of the person who left it.
The OBjectiveStudent model has a column for "teacher score" which doesn't affect any of a student's term scores.
    We need a scoresheet option where the teacher can input this
Set_objectives_and_scores should be a model method so that it can be better tested

OBJECTIVES EDITING VIEWS

Editing objectives should get the same treatment as seminar editing and student view.
Then get rid of the forced redirection to quantities, etc.
Don't show the regular navribbon while editing label quantities.



DELETE GOALS



QUESTIONS YOU MISSED

Students can pull up questions they missed on quizzes. 


GROWTH STARS
If a student takes a quiz that he has already taken before and improves his score, the app create a record in the "GrowthStars" table.
This record is attached to the objective_student.
It is dated so that the teacher can look growth stars for a specific term.

CONSULTANT STARS
If a classmate from your consultant team earns growth stars, the consultant earns half that many growth stars. (Round up)
If the classmate has never taken the quiz before, no growth stars will be earned. But the consultant can earn 1/4 of the teammate's fresh stars. (Round up)
Consultant stars should probably be a separate model, just like growth stars. 
They're dated, so the teacher can look at consultant stars for a specific term. 

TOTAL STARS
Show the total number of stars that a student has earned within a term. 
One option is to count all of the quizzes that were taken during the window that the teacher designates.
    It's a bit weird, since a student might get 3 stars for "Angle Concepts" during Term 2, and then earn 5 full stars again for "Angle Concepts" during Term 3. 
        That student will also earn some growth stars.
    I'm leaning toward this option, to give more favor to students who improve from a 9 to a 10. 
        Then again, this student is probably the consultant, so she's probably earning consultant stars in addition to the growth stars. 
Another option is to only count the improvement, which is the growth stars.
    If so, there should be a "growth star bonus" with a minimum of 2 or 3 stars if the student shows any improvement at all.
    This option might hurt the grade a bit for students who only improve from a 9 to a 10. That's only 4 stars, if there's a full bonus. This student would need to complete an extra quiz to stay
        caught up with the students who earned 8 stars for taking a quiz that they hadn't taken before. 
Perhaps the app could find the average between these two options?

ADJUSTMENT STARS FOR STUDENTS WHO JOIN A CLASS LATER
How to pro-rate stars to make things as fair as possible for new arrival students? 
It will take a few rounds before the newer student can have a turn to be consultant. 
And the new student won't be earning many growth stars until she finishes all of her pre-tests
I think I should re-initiate the solution that involves giving that student the median number of total stars to begin with.
But give a little more than the median (maybe 75%) to account for the other aspects.



LOOK AT THE CURRENT TERM'S SCORES


LIST ABSENT STUDENTS IN DESK CONSULTANTS
Test that absent students are featured in a separate section in DeskConsultants, not the main section


INCLUDE GOALS IN SCORESHEET

And in student's total scores




EASIER SEARCHING
Searching needs to collect results that are similar to what the user typed.
And it isn't downcasing results like it use to. User must match capitalization to find results.


ACCESS
The "Questions" controller needs before_action stoppers
    And the questions_index_test needs to test for them
    And check which other models need similar updates
Look again at Hartl's section about not editing admin via the web.
Ensure that students cannot url into unauthorized objectives
Check before_action for security of student page


APPEARANCE
Most buttons should be turned into big links
There are too many buttons on teacher show page.
    Move most of them into "content-creation" view.
Create icons for
    Benchmark
    School
    Move Student, green arrow pointing right
    Remove Student, red arrow pointing left
Clean up Nav ribbon
Margin on the subtitle under EM Education
Header links are hard to see
If I can't figure out how to make the header stay fixed above the columns, then I at least need to split the table into smaller tables
Use CSS for before/after margin on div class="singleOption" instead of using </br>
Better icons for DConsult, etc.
Put icons on all of the buttons, such as "Create a New Label" and "All Labels" The "All Labels" icon should include more labels than the regular.
"Add rows for ten more students" should be a big_link. Look at all other buttons that should be changed to big links like this one.
Consistent cell size in scoresheet
Consistent cell size in desk-consultants
Zebra striping for scoresheet columns?
Take a closer look at fonts
Look at css for headings
A better visual for the student's total stars can include some big stars for 10 and some giant stars for 100
Small icons for each class period
In the scoresheet, don't show cell border unless cell is focused




STUDENT ALL-GOALS VIEW

Student can open a screen to show all of her goals
Select box for choosing target needs to be smaller
Due date is shown when student checks her main profile


UPDATE CHECKPOINT CHOICES UPON GOAL CHOICE

When teacher chooses a goal, the checkpoint options for that goal are automatically updated
Same for when student is choosing a goal
    Move the checkpoint choices to the same screen
    




TESTING OF PICS
How do I test that pics are uploaded and changed?
# assert_not_equal old_pic, @user_p.image
# Learn how to test this some day

MECHANISM TO ALLOW USERS TO GIVE FEEDBACK


        
CLEAN UP JAVASCRIPTS AND STYLESHEETS
http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project





ORGANIZING PICTURES
Organizing them by label, the way I am currently doing, is a bad idea. Teachers cannot use community pictures for their questions because they cannot
    edit the labels of a picture. Instead, I should prompt the user for whether she wants to be offered pictures from Algebra, Geometry, etc.
Pictures will be associated with those domains.
Find a better way to organize the other long lists, too
    "Labels" comes to mind first


ADD INFO BUTTONS FOR ALL FIELDS ON ALL FORMS
Look for all places where users might need a little extra help/advice
There's a blanked-out info button to explain pre-requisites in the objectives form.
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" id="btn-info1">?</button>
The jquery for showing those info buttons needs to be dried down to one single function.



AUTO-UPDATE TOTAL
The "total" field in the scoresheet should update upon changing one of that students' scores.
Scoresheet show show mean and median for objectives

ACCOUNT ACTIVATIONS
Since the teacher's profile shows a request for them to activate their account, it should also include a link to send a second activation email. 
Or get rid of that message until I do have that taken care of.

CHECK MAILERS
Are they working properly since I reloaded the app?

CURATED CONTENT
Should have another type of user called "Content Creator"
Admin or content creators can curate questions.
Teachers can choose whether their students will see all questions, or only curated questions.


UNTRIED OBJECTIVES
Some other symbol, instead of zero, should go in the scoresheet to keep track of objectives that haven't been attempted yet.


TIME-SENSITIVE GRADEBOOK
Allow option to show only scores that were updated within the current term.
Will need term model.
    Or maybe term rows in seminar model.



CUSTOM DISPLAY FOR DESK CONSULTANTS
Teachers need to be able to choose how many groups wide their display is.
Someday, consider allowing different-sized groups. Maybe now?

FRIENDLY WARNINGS BEFORE ANNOUNCING
Errors for updating scores to invalid values in the scoresheet

STUDENT REQUEST UPDATING
Update a student's learn_requests when that student passes an objective. 
    If that student had learn_requested to learn the objective she just passed, her learn_request should become neutral.
Remove the part of the D-C algorithm that checks whether student has scored below 100 in his request.

TEACHER EDITING OF STUDENT PASSWORDS
Allow teachers to reset student passwords, but not to edit them.

WRITE UPDATE PLAN
Make a plan for how to roll out updates after more users are using the apps.

    
PICTURE NEEDS EXTENT

Pictures that are uploaded need to have a column for public/private extent
    And a column for user
Test for all the results of extent that are tested for in the other models
Test for picture AND FOR QUESTION should include changing the extent



******
BEGIN SERIOUSLY ANNOUNCING THE APP
Quora article: Which websites should a Front-end developer look up to for inspiration?
Finish viedoes to explain/market the app
Try to recruit several teachers to begin using and providing feedback
    E-mail teachers who had an account in the old app.
    Talk with MaryAnn Moore

******

ALLOW FIVE LEVELS OF PRIORITY
Instead of 3



VIEW A SINGLE GOAL
Also needs to be able to zoom in on one specific goal_student, for conferencing with that student
    View should be the same for both teacher and student


STUDY LINKS
Create "link" model
Teachers and admin can add links to outside websites
    Ideally, they will be links to games and practice activities
Each objectives can be associated with links
Teachers can set those links to outside websites
Students can view them and follow the path.

MORE QUIZ UNLOCKS
Unlock quiz if student has clicked at least two "study links"
    That part should go into the Score model.
    Don't show a quiz available if it has no questions
    

DRY FORM FOR QUESTION CREATION
The form for creating questions is the only one that doesn't use the partial for public/private extent. I paused there because of the input name and because questions
    needs to be pluralized in the new question creator.
    

REPORTS
Show teachers some aggregated data from objectives.
And specific questions.


AWARDS
Students can collect awards with their stars and goal achievements.

TARGETED STUDY GUIDES

The Desk Consultants system that I've been using is not proving very helpful for many students. The next idea that I have to improve the system is to find a way to get each student talking about a 
question he can answer correctly, where possible. Then have the student try to fix a question he missed.

Would be really cool if the app could create them automatically. Pull two correct and two inccorect questions for each student.
    Perhaps even merge them with spaces for taking notes on their groupmate's ideas.
    But students who have never tried that objective will still need the explanatory study guide.

POSSIBLE UPDATE TO D-C ALGORITHM
If no students are proficient in a priority 3 assignments, consider setting the Threshold to consult that topic to be the highest score in class.
    But not if it's zero.


TARGETED STUDY GUIDE
If a student is assigned to a D-C group for an objective she has already tried, teacher can print a custom study guide showing the questions and answers that the student missed on previous tries.


SPIRAL REVIEW
Allow students to take a small review quiz for topics that they've already passed.
Perhaps grant them some kind of points or rewards for these spiral reviews.
If students do porrly on some lables, mark them for some kind of future review or refresher.
In the future, allow hints on spiral reviews and practice quizzes.

DELETING STUDENT REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL-CASE EVENTS
Student might make a request for an objective, but then teachers later changes the priority for the objective or the consutlant threshold for the class.
Perhaps this should be handled by deleting the student's request in either of these events.
Check whether other events should have the same effect.

PRACTICE QUIZZES
With some objectives, students should be able to take the quiz as practice
    This will be especially useful for objectives that don't currently have study links
    

TEACHER CAN ADJUST CONSULTANCY
Teacher should be able to move a student from one team to another after the consutlancies are created.
But those moves should check for student readiness. And non-mastery at 100%
Need to be able to save the consultancy after adjusting
In creating Consultant groups, create a group of absent students
    The teacher can pull the absent student out of that group if those students arrive later.

CONSULTANT STARS
 
GROWTH POINTS
Need to add "last_growth" type column to objective_sudent
    When a student improves score, update last_growth to today's date
    If there is growth, but last_growth was the same day, then don't add growth points. (They need to take it again on a different day to earn those points.)

REMOVE QUIZ FROM DESK CONSULTANTS OFFERINGS AFTER STUDENT HAS TAKEN IT TWICE
Count the number of attempts since the most recent time working that objective with desk consultants
    If there are more than one, that quiz is no longer offered to the student.
Or else close after one attempt if the day ends
Automatically add consultant stars

PRE-TEST MODE
Explanation: Some objectives are unlocked from the beginning as pre-tests. But then students might later take those same objectives after consultant groups.
There should be an indicator whether a certain quiz was taken as a pre-test or not.
    Or maybe I should just update the "locked" status of that objective. Once a student unlocks a quiz for any other reason, it will no longer be available in the pre-test section
If a student fails a quiz while in Pre-Test mode, lock all post-requisites of that objective where they are potential pre-tests
    So the student will no longer have them open as a pre-test until earning them by passing off the pre-requisities.

DISABLE "NEXT QUESTION" BUTTON UNTIL STUDENT CHOOSES A RESPONSE
Goal: Disable the "Next" button until the student gives some kind of answer
Add a "previous question" button

TEACHERS CAN INVITE OTHER TEACHERS TO THE SCHOOL
If the invited teacher follows the link, their e-mail is auto-filled in the signup form so that it matches the addess that was invited.
The school is also auto-filled.
Teacher invited by the school mentor are automatically verified.

MENTOR CAN REMOVE TEACHERS FROM A SCHOOL
When that happens, all students sponsored by that teacher are removed from the school
   
ENABLE HTML IN QUESTIONS
I can go a long way toward making the questions look nicer if content-creators can use html when creating the prompts and answers.

CREATE LABEL WHILE CREATING QUESTION
I give the option to create a new label while creating questions, then it won't be tedious to add many questions to the 

VETO ANSWER-SCRAMBLING
Option to not randomize the answer choices for multiple-choice questions.

STUDENT VIEW INTO MULTIPLE SUB-VIEWS
Basically, make the initial view cleaner. But give the student the option to open other divs.
Students should be able to view their old quizzes.
Won't need to setup scores in all the tests that view the student_view
 
LINK TO THE MATERIALS SITE SO THAT I CAN SHARE THE MATERIALS I'VE CREATED
Change the heroku name
Make sure that everything is functioning for the regular site in case people start using it.
Need an icon for every class. Seminar, Teacher, etc.
Update the materials site



AJAX STUDENT ADDING, SIMILAR TO CLASSDOJO
Make sure that the new system makes it easy to add multiple existing students to a class at once

ADD SOMETHING FUN OR INTERESTING BEFORE MORE BORING FEATURES
Perhaps student comments within classes. 



REFRESHING CERTAIN SCREENS
The "question details" screen causes an error when user refreshes. Perhaps it's because it's a custom view. Maybe I should simply load that functionality into a standard view.
Reloading label form directs to index
    
ONLY ALLOW QUIZ-TAKING ON CERTAIN DAYS AND TIMES        
Main Goal: Teacher can lock and unlock quizzes
    Seminar needs an "unlocked days" attribute.
        It will be an array that includes the available days.
        Unlock time
        Re-lock time
    Teacher can set this up in class attributes once. So that quizzes are open on a certain day between a certain start and end time.
Students cannot take the quiz outside of the open time.
But there also needs to be an "Quick Unlock" button so that teacher can quickly allow quiz-taking on an off-day.

MULTIPLE-SELECT QUESTIONS

SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS
Teacher must review these questions and provide a score.

QUIZ SCORE CALCULATION
Should calculate the final quiz results before going to the quiz show page.
    The way it currently works, it gives results of zero when the student refreshes the screen.
    I think I'll need to add an "old_score" column to quiz table in order to get that working properly.

COPY A CLASS
Save teachers time by copying a class when creating a new one.
    Include settings for objective and pretest.
        But the name of the new class must be unique
When creating a class, there is a list of already-created classes. The teacher can choose one of them to copy.
When creating/editing a class, the first screen shows only the field for class name

COPY AN OBJECTIVE

ADMIN CAN CREATE NEW ADMIN

IMAGES AS ANSWER CHOICES
This feature may not be completely necessary. But it would help with fractions and similar needs.

EQUATION-EDITOR FOR FILL-IN ANSWERS
Some way for students to enter fractions and exponents in their answers.
    Or maybe implement multi-box fill-in answers. then the student can input the numerator and denominator.

FRIENDLY WARNINGS
Alert the teacher if she is creating a fill-in question without any correct answers
Don't give message, "Students added to class" if zero students were added. Also, give errors if any students were not saved. Do the same with the 
    multi-question creator.
Before the userchanges an objective to priority level 3.
If there's trouble logging in, add a message reminding users that teachers use an e-mail address, but students use a username.


         
ELL STUDENTS
Allow students to be marked as ELL. When that happens, they are default exempt from text-heavy objectives and questions
 
TEACHER CAN ADD A CUSTOM CHECKPOINT
Teacher can add a custom checkpoint

SMALL IMPROVEMENTS TO COMPLETE MUCH LATER
When there's only one public objective, the list looks really weird.
    I'm sure the problem is the same for private objectives.
@created_by needs to include the users full title
Make a partial for the name and extent on each form.
When the user is selecting the number of questions from each label, that select box will be blank for a label that has no questions. This screen 
    needs some kind of warning or explanation for this fact.
When creating a multiple-choice question, don't allow the user to mark a blank answer as the correct answer.
    But at least one answer choice must be marked as true.
    And at least two answer choices are offered.
If student has taken a quiz six times, the oldest attempt is destroyed
In the quiz-finishing screen, give options for the student to change his/her consultant requests.
"Has_objective" method should probably be removed and replaced with rails association
Edit multiple questions at once
Some changes are made by ajax. Some changes are made with a Save + Submit button. That should be consistent.
"I don't like these consultant groups" button after D-C results. User clicks this button to get ideas about how to improve the results.
At the very end, if there's a single student in a group, and another group has the same topic, move one of the students from the group to work with the lone student.
Suggestion to student for which objective to study next should prioritize a score of zero that the student is ready for. 
    I think the same should go for apprentice requests.
Include precondition info in the assigments index.
If a student has already made a request, that request should appear in the student's choices even if it didn't come up from priority and scores.
After performing a search, the search option should default to the previously-used attribute, instead of defaulting to user_number
Home screen should offer log in space instead of having to click the log in button to reach the login form.
Add multiple pictures at once
Allow teachers to delete their own accounts
If user tries to add an existing student to a class twice, it produces a fatal error. But I think that only happens when c9 or something is being super slow.
Print list of student names and passwords
It's awkward that "student_view" is in the seminar controller. It should be in the student controller.
Add Instructions in the Help menu
In the materials, include papers that are given at presentations.
Admin should be able to create classes for the users that they are visiting
Larger font on main headings.
Video to walk people through initial setup.
I commented out the "Remember me on this computer" feature. Should I leave it gone? or should I try to bring it back?
Student awards feature, so students can vote for each other for "Most helpful", "Most creative," "Funniest," etc.
Feature to create seating chart by achievement.
Reset absences upon starting a new day.
Upload student roster from Excel
A system of daily hints that appear upon login. For example: Remind teachers to add objectives that nobody has completed yet. Those will
    become the enrichment objectives for students who are not placed in a group.
On the "New Student" form, highlight the first and last name fields, since they're the only ones that teachers actually need to fill out.
Fix the double horzontal line that shows after each student when somebody searches the student index.
When creating a new objective, should it automatically check the box for the current class if the objectives form was accessed through a class?
It's a little bit weird that user can't leave second answer choice blank. But that's not a really big problem.
Allow teachers and admin to edit their user_numbers upon creation and updating
     offer a field in the regular form, but hide it until a button is pressed.
Right now the make_username method ends by generating a random token if the first four tries fail. If the site ever has a million users, I'll need to ensure that
    it's generating a unique token for the username
Option to show "My questions only" in "All Questions"

CUSTOM GOALS
Teachers need to be able to create new goals
Ensure that all goals include at least one actions option is offered for all three checkpoints. Otherwise there will be errors.
When writing actions, there should be an option to copy actions from #1 to #3.

OPTIONAL FEATURES TO CONSIDER SOME DAY
Upload student photos. Or have student icons.
